### Challenge 003

Create a function that takes a String and modify it using the following algorithm.

Replace every letter in the string with the letter following it in the alphabet (ie. c becomes d, z becomes a).
Then capitalize every vowel in this new string (a, e, i, o, u) and finally return this modified string.

Create a function that receives a String parameter and return the largest word in the string. 
 - If there are two or more words that are the same length, return the first word from the string with that length. 
 - Ignore punctuation and assume the input will not be empty.
